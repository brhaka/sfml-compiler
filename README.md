#### The base of this repository is a clone of [sfml-compile](https://github.com/87cm1n3r/sfml-compiler). We added some fixes and better documentation.

This package can be used to compile [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) stuff on windows

To use you must include MinGW/bin in system PATH (you should be able to execute 'g++ --version' command) and download SFML

Requirements for sfml-compiler are easy to install, you can read all that stuff on the [wiki](https://github.com/brhaka/sfml-compiler/wiki)
